# Restaurant Review System

This Python code contains a basic restaurant review system built using SQLAlchemy, a powerful SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for Python.

# Description
In this system I have three main models:

# 1. Restaurant Class
Represents restaurants and includes methods to retrieve reviews, customers, and perform operations related to reviews.

# 2. Customer Class
Represents customers and includes methods to retrieve reviews, restaurants, add reviews, delete reviews, and find favorite restaurants.

# 3 Review Class
Represents individual reviews left by customers for specific restaurants.
